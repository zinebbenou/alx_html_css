# Web Page Implementation

In this project, we will create a fully functional web page from scratch using only HTML and CSS. Follow the design provided by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.

## Requirements
- No external CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap)
- No JavaScript

## Tasks
1. Familiarize yourself with the Figma design.
   - Create an account on Figma and duplicate the project to your drafts for access to design details.
   - [Access the Figma file] https://www.figma.com/file/TwFqqWGYvNYvxZxhdWXv4H/Holberton-School---Headphone-company.

## Important Notes
- If you lack the fonts used, download them here: [Source Sans Pro] https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro and [Spin Cycle OT] https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT.
- Some values are in float; feel free to round them.

## Interactions
- The web page must switch to mobile version at screen width of 480px or less.
- Links hover/active color: `#FF6565`
- Button hover/active: opacity `0.9`
- Max content width: 1000px, centered on the page.
